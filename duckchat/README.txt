Make Instructions:
Just run 'make all' to compile client and server.
You can also run 'make client' and 'make server' to compile client and server individually.

Resources Used:
Lots of help about basic socket programming received from Beej's Guide to Socket Programming:
https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/multipage/index.html
Implementations for the LinkedList and HashMap ADTs that this server uses were borrowed from
professor Joe Sventek's ADT library on github (https://github.com/jsventek/ADTs).
These implementations are not my own.
